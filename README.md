## Installation

Install with composer:

```sh
composer require davwheat/flarum-ext-ads:"*"
```

## Updating

```sh
composer update davwheat/flarum-ext-ads:"*"
php flarum migrate

## Usage

Head to your admin dashboard and enable the extension. Switch on the Ad Unit locations you'd like, then paste your ad code in the textboxes below.

If you use "between post" ads, make sure to configure the gap between ads in the extension settings page.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **If you use Google AdSense**, only insert the `<ins>` tag into the textbox.


> ‚ö†Ô∏è The text boxes **do not** support `<script>` tags. These scripts will not be executed if you enter them into the text boxes, due to how Mithril functions.
